# 3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
 values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
    
Ans : OR                    AND                      NOT 
     
    A    B     A+B=C     A    B     A*B=C          A    B      
    
    0    0      0       0     0      0            0     1

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

Ans:
    Assigment  (=) operator is use to assigenr value to the variable 
    Equal(==) operator is use to compare to values

# 8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
# Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam
spam = 0
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
if spam ==2:
    print("Hoedy")
else:
    print("Greetings")
    

    


# 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
# 
# Ans :CTRL + C 

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().set_next_input('10.How can you tell the difference between break and continue');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'continue')

Ans : Break statment is used to terminate the specific conditaion and stop that particulat itertation
    Continue statment is used to skip particular itertation

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Ans : range (10) = range from 0 to 9
      range(0, 10)=  range from 0 to 9
      range(0, 10, 1) = range from 0 to 9 with step 1

# 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
 # program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
    
# for loop                      
i=1                          
for i in range (0,11):       
    print(i)

# while loop
   
i=1
while i<=10:
   print(i)
   i=+1

13.If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
get_ipython().set_next_input('importing spam');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'spam')
 Ans : The function can be caller spam.bacon()
